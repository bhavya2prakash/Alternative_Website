           We have taken the initative to start online business for manufacturing the jute bags which is nowadays on  high demand because in India some state governments have banned PE / plastic bags less than 20 micrometers thick. The strategy was to discourage the production of less recyclable specification. In addition, supermarkets have started charging for carry bags to make customer aware. The strategy as consumer should be “Buy plastic bag and use it atleast 7-10 times, dispose it scientifically”.<br>

     Alternatively, jute bags can be a good choice and using them can contribute for a social cause in addition to environmental protection.<br>
